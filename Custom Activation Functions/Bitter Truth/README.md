#### Bitter Truth of My Activation Functions

##### So far, I've independently created three promising custom activation functions:

1. Ghost ReLU (and its variant Eclipse)
2. Gammoid (a smooth replacement for tanh)
3. Neutron

- Only later did I realize — many of these had already been explored.
- Ghost ReLU and Gammoid closely resemble ideas tested in Google Brain's RNN-based reinforcement models (which led to Swish). When I simplified the formula
  for Neutron, it also boiled down to... Swish.
- Yes — I unknowingly reinvented it.

##### What's the Point Then?

- Even if these ideas already existed, I discovered them independently, implemented, and benchmarked them in real use cases. But I didn't just copy — 
 I added value:

- Ghost ReLU: Introduced a sigmoid domain control for slope tweaking.
  Example: X * Sigmoid(1.735 * Tanh(X)) — gives asymmetric control over gradient flow.

- Neutron: X * a^X / (1 + a^X)
  Where a adjusts the non-monotonic dip on the negative side — modulating negative learning behavior. It's a sharper, controlled Swish with more structure.

##### Introducing Atomic Swish: My refinement of Swish: f(X) = X/1+a^X 

- This removes the dependency on exponential base e, giving more flexibility and numerical control.

##### Bottom Line
- I didn't invent the wheel. But I reshaped it on my own, gave it new treads, and tested it on real terrain.

##### Independent rediscovery isn’t failure — it’s proof of intuition.
##### And refinement is where true engineering begins.
