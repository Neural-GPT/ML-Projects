In this project, I collect pushups data, where target variable is pushups done by me throughout the day. The data contains several features, all experienced and recorded 
by me. Not gonna lie, for a few days I even used the prediction of the model even before I started doing any pushups, and used it's prediction as my target for the day,
lol! I've attached the jupyter notebook which has the code and the data file, which is an excel spreadsheet file, as well. You can run the jupyter notebook either through local
jupyter lab or google colab.
